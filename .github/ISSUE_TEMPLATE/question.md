## Prework

* [ ] Read and agree to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* [ ] If there is [already a relevant issue](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues), whether open or closed, comment on the existing thread instead of posting a new issue.
* [ ] For any problems you identify, a [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) so the maintainer can troubleshoot. A reproducible example is:
    * [ ] **Runnable**: post enough R code and data so any onlooker can create the error on their own computer.
    * [ ] **Minimal**: reduce runtime wherever possible and remove complicated details that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.
    * [ ] **Readable**: format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
